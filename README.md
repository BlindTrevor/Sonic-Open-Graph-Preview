## Usage

### Getting Started

After installation and activation:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Sonic OG Preview** in your WordPress admin
2. Enable the social media platforms you want to preview (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn)
3. Save your settings

### In Classic WordPress Editor

3. Click through different platform tabs to see how your content will appear on each platform
4. Click **"Refresh Preview"** to update the preview after making changes to your content
5. The preview automatically updates when you change the featured image

**Tip:** If you don't see the meta box, click **Screen Options** at the top of the page and ensure "Social Media Preview" is checked.

### In Elementor Editor

1. Open a page in Elementor editor
2. Look for the **floating share icon button** in the bottom-right corner of the screen
3. Click the button to open the preview panel
4. Navigate between different platforms using the tabs

### Settings

- **Control preview display**: Configure where and how previews appear in your WordPress admin

All settings are saved automatically when you click **Save Changes**.

## How It Works

The plugin intelligently extracts Open Graph metadata in the following priority order:

1. **Custom OG meta fields** (if set using `_og_preview_*` meta keys)
2. **Yoast SEO** OG fields (if Yoast SEO plugin is installed and configured)
3. **Rank Math** OG fields (if Rank Math SEO plugin is installed and configured)
4. **WordPress defaults**:
   - Featured image for OG image
   - Post title for OG title
   - Post excerpt (or trimmed content) for OG description
   - Site logo as fallback for OG image

The preview shows you exactly how your content will appear when shared on social media, including:

- **Title**: The headline that appears in the social media card
- **Description**: The text snippet shown below the title
- **Image**: The visual thumbnail displayed with your link
- **URL**: The link that will be shared

Each platform has a slightly different card design, which the preview accurately reflects.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this plugin modify my actual Open Graph tags?

No, the plugin only provides a visual preview. It reads existing OG tags from your SEO plugins or WordPress defaults. If you want to customize the actual OG tags that appear in your page source, use a SEO plugin like Yoast SEO or Rank Math.

### Do I need a SEO plugin to use this?

No! The plugin works without any SEO plugin by using WordPress defaults (featured image, post title, excerpt). However, it works great alongside Yoast SEO or Rank Math if you want more control over your OG tags.

### Which social media platforms are supported?

Currently, the plugin supports previews for:
- Facebook
- Twitter
- WhatsApp
- LinkedIn

### Does this work with custom post types?

Yes! The plugin works with all public post types, including custom post types.

### Will this slow down my site?

No, the previews only load in the WordPress admin area when editing posts/pages. They don't affect your front-end site performance at all.

### Can I customize the preview appearance?

Yes, developers can use the `og_preview_tags` filter to modify the OG tags before they're displayed in the preview. See the [Filters](#filters) section below.
